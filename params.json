{"name":"Ruby-io-tail","body":"# IO::Tail for Ruby\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a small ruby library that allows it to \"tail\" various IOs in Ruby, including\r\nfollowing a file, that still is growing like the unix command 'tail -f' can.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe latest version of <b>IO::Tail</b> (io-tail) can be found at\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/octplane/ruby-io-tail\r\n\r\nOnline Documentation should be located at\r\n\r\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/octplane/ruby-io-tail/\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install io-tail via its gem type:\r\n\r\n`gem install io-tail`\r\n\r\nTo install from the source repository, just type into the command line as root:\r\n\r\n`rake install`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFile::Tail is a module in the File class. A lightweight class interface for\r\nlogfiles can be seen under File::Tail::Logfile.\r\n\r\nDirect extension of File objects with File::Tail works like that:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n File.open(filename) do |log|\r\n   log.extend(File::Tail)\r\n   log.interval = 10\r\n   log.backward(10)\r\n   log.tail { |line| puts line }\r\n end\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to mix File::Tail in your own File classes\r\n(see also File::Tail::Logfile):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n class MyFile < File\r\n   include File::Tail\r\n end\r\n log = MyFile.new(\"myfile\")\r\n log.interval = 10\r\n log.backward(10)\r\n log.tail { |line| print line }\r\n```\r\nThe forward/backward method returns self, so it's possible to chain\r\nmethods together like that:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n log.backward(10).tail { |line| puts line }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA command line utility named rtail, that uses File::Tail is provided as well.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nTo create the documentation of this module, type\r\n\r\n`rake doc`\r\n\r\nand the API documentation is generated.\r\n\r\nIn the examples directory is a small example of tail and\r\npager program that use this module. You also may want look\r\nat the end of file/tail.rb for a little example.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nPierre Baillet mailto:pierre@baillet.name\r\n\r\nFlorian Frank mailto:flori@ping.de\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\r\n","tagline":"IO::Tail for ruby","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
